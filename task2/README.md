# Task 2

Ahh!!  Julia, new language:persevere:. First I set up the environment for Julia on my PC, read tutorials to know basic syntax. Then run the code, without giving a shit about what it was. Wait what?? secrets.jl?? FLAG is defined there??? First I googled it :stuck_out_tongue: wishing it might be some standard file. [This](https://geniejl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/14--The_Secrets_File/) was ranked first.

blah... blah.. something something  `.gitignore` ?? There was a file [.gitignore](https://github.com/CSEA-IITB/Assignment/blob/main/.gitignore) in the repo and it had secrets :innocent: . 

```
.vscode/

secrets*
```

I never used .gitignore so was unaware of it. Ok so it was a file on @jsahil730 's PC. I thought we had to ask for this file for this task and run [this](https://github.com/geekyuttu/csec-convener-assignment/blob/main/task2/challenge.jl) code to get the flag as output. After all this was more like exploring github and we had to ping OofNoicety#1900 when we get stuck :smiley: . 

Ok that was not the case then I read the comment at the end. Why the colour of the comment matches with the dark background of github :weary: . Ok it was over now. I run the code on jupyter-notebook to know what each line way doing then wrote [this](https://github.com/geekyuttu/csec-convener-assignment/blob/main/task2/script.py) script to get this.

```bash
['f', 'l', 'a', 'g', '{', 'm', 'u', '1', 't', 'i', 'p', 'l', '3', '_', 'd', 'i', '5', 'p', '4', 't', 'c', 'h', '_', '1', 's', '_', '4', 'w', 'e', '5', '0', 'm', 'e', '}']
```

Meanwhile I was also searching for random bullshits for task 3 and came to know about leetspeak. So numbers between letters didn't surprised me.

So the flag for task 2 was `multiple_dispatch_is_awesome`.
