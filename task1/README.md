## Part 1

The task stared with searching [this](https://github.com/jsahil730/Assignment/tree/develop/folder) git repo. Ahh we simply had to search branches, The first part of the flag was the type of hash used by git as default. Did a google search didn't know it :( . Bang!!! first part of the flag is **SHA-1** . 

## Part 2

Now we had to read commits so I cloned the repo and opened it in sublime merge. It's easier to read changes made to repo there​ :grin: ​.

Found this deleted file **file.md** this part of the flag was easier **main**.

## Part 3

Ok when I went there, there was only one fork now there are three more :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:. **ssl-team-aas** was the  forked repo I checked and in its latest commit was the final part of the flag. I didn't know about **workflow** but Google :relieved: helped. 

So the  the flag is **SHA-1_main_workflow**
